# Upgrade Description File
#
# This file contains the settings used by the upgrade generation tool
# to produce an Impinj firmware upgrade file.
[Description]

# Version is a 4 part number in decimal with each part limited to
# 0-255. It is the version of the upgrade file to be generated.
Version = 1.0.0.1

# Valid Reader Hardware is a string designating the reader models onto which
# you can load the upgrade.  The following strings are acceptable values for
# this field:
#   R700
#   R700V2
#   R510
#   R515
#   R***
# The "R***" wildcard indicates that you can load the CAP onto any reader, and
# effectively bypasses this check.
Valid Reader Hardware = R700

# File System Layout is an value used by the reader to determine how
# the upgrade partition should be loaded to flash. Currently the only
# supported layout version is 10.
# File System Layout = 10

# Input Directory is the top-level directory of the filesystem to
# create. The files under this directory will be available on the
# reader under /cust after the upgrade is loaded.
Input Directory = /etk/cap

# Encrypt the upgrade filesystem content. Note this will be
# decrypted when the upgrade file is processed by the reader.
# The default is 'False' (don't encrypt)
#Encrypt = True

# Should point to the cert from the key pair used to encrypt the bundle.
#Recipients = ./<key_dir>/cap_enc.cert.pem

# The above cert.pem can be generated with:
#
# openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout cap_enc.key.pem -out \
#   cap_enc.cert.pem -sha256 -days 365
#
# Choose any passphrase, you only have to enter it in the next step. Create
# a p12 bundle:
#
# openssl pkcs12 -export -out cap_enc_key-bundle.p12 -in cap_enc.cert.pem \
#   -inkey cap_enc.key.pem
#
# Here, you must define a passphrase for the p12 bundle after entering the pem
# passphrase.
#
# Then upload bundle to the reader:
#
# curl -k -u root:impinj -X POST -F "upload=@cap_enc_key-bundle.p12" \
#   -F"password=<passphrase>" \
#   https://$READER_IP/api/v1/system/certificates/tls/certs
#
# Which should reply with [1] or whatever ID was assigned to the cert.
# Activate CAP encryption for that cert:
#
# curl -k -u root:impinj -X PUT -d "{\"certId\":1}" \
#   https://$READER_IP/api/v1/system/certificates/tls/services/cap-encryption

# Use the expanded NAND Flash partition sizes available on
# all Revolution based readers and gateways with PCBAs equal or
# greater than v5.00.
# The default is 'False' (build for all PCBAs).
#ExpandedNAND = True

# Persist a file or directory across a CAP install.  This file or
# directory will be copied from the existing CAP in to the new CAP
# during install.  Path is relative to the root of the CAP.
# Persistent Data = myconfig.json
